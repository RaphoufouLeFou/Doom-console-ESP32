The console has an 1800 mAh battery, lasting in theroy for more than 15h of gaming

Main processor : esp32-S3 with 8Mb of flash, and 8Mb of RAM, dual core, running at 240Mhz.

The screen is an LCD 2.4' SPI display, with a resolution of 320*240, and 16 bits colors.

# Doom

The doom port for the esp32 was originaly created by ESPRESSIF, but i have modified it.

Due to the limited storage avalable on the console, we are limited to one world at a time loaded on the console.

The saveing system has been re-worked and now work prefecty.

Doom run on one core of the ESP32, the other core is reserved to the display.

Doom run at a nearly constant 35 fps, whith is pretty good

# Render-Test

This app is and early prototype of an minecraft like blocky game whith my own render engine. It's preaty bad for the moment and it require a lot of new functionalities and optimisations.

For the moment, the engine can only render cubes with any x y z positions and x y z sizes, with any color in the 16 bits palette of the LCD screen.

I've tested it with 55 cubes to make a little house, but it only go up to 20-25 fps, but it's still kinda cool.
